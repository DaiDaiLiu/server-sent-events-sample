Server-sent Events Java Sample
=========================

This is a sample Java based web application which uses HTML 5 [Server-sent events](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) and supports IE 8+.

This sample application is based on 
* [Jetty EventSource Serlvet](https://github.com/jetty-project/jetty-eventsource-servlet)
* [Yaffle's EventSource](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource) polyfill library 

How to use
-------------------------
The sample project is built using [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org), just use `gradle jettyRun` to start the Jetty server and point your browser to [http://localhost:8080/sse/](http://localhost:8080/sse/). In the page, you should see a red rectangle moving randomly in the page.
